<p><font size="5"><u>Why was the southern sector of the Somme so
successful ?</u></font></p>

<p>On the first day of the Somme, over the northern 2/3rds of the
British sector the battle went as badly as all the accounts we
have seen or read. Hardly any soldiers reached the enemy trenches
alive, and the few that did were soon killed. As many as 30% of
the soldiers died before even reaching their own front line. So
was this always destined to be impossible, a suicide mission ?</p>

<p>In the south the troops in XV corps advanced up to 2km in the
morning, achieving all their objectives and with few Germans left
ahead of them. The French army further south also took all their
objectives on the first day. So why was there such a difference,
and could this have been repeated over the whole front ? Robin
Prior and Trevor Wilson in their book &quot;The Somme&quot; have
studied all the reports and assessed where luck, or tactics made
such a difference.</p>

<p><u>Luck</u></p>

<p>There was high ground behind the British front line here, so
it was possible to observe the whole German rear area and direct
the artillery. </p>

<p>The French seemed to have much better supply of artillery, and
directed a lot towards the area of the British XV corps to knock
out the German artillery. The XV corp had aimed most of their
artillery at the Germans lines, so without this French support
the German guns would have been relatively untouched.</p>

<p>The Germans had built very few deep dugouts behind the front
line, in contrast to their defences further north.</p>

<p><u>Tactics</u></p>

<p>The XV corp soldiers were ordered to advance before the
barrage lifted, and many were only 50-60 yards from the German
lines. In contrast</p>
