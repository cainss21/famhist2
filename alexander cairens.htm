<title>Alexander Cairens in Northumberland militia</title>
</head>

<blockquote>
    <p align="left"><font size="5"><u>Alexander Cairens</u></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4">I have traced my family line back to Alexander
Cairens ( really Alexander Cairns ?), born around 1755 (from his
recorded age at death). He served in the </font><a
href="northumberland-militia.htm"><font size="4">Northumberland
Militia</font></a><font size="4"> so I would have thought he was
born in Northumberland, but the IGI index has no record of any
Alexander Cairens or Cairns born <strong><u>anywhere</u></strong><u>
</u>in England between 1750 and 1760. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">However the Northumberland militia records show
that 11% of the men in Alexander's company came from Scotland,
and the IGI have 6 Alexander Cairns ( but no Alexander Cairens)
born between 1753 and 1758 in Scotland, so Alexander was probably
one of these 6, but I have no way of knowing which one. Four of
these came from Fife, the other 2 from Edinburgh and Fraserburgh.
So my best guess would be Fife, but that is really the end of the
records.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Going further back, I tried a genetic test for
my male line. Oxford Ancestors said my Y chromosome ( the
Cains/Cairns male line) is probably of Celtic origin, so
descended from some of the earliest people to settle in Britain,
rather than from any later invasions such as Anglo-Saxon, Norman
etc.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">And even further back, Genetree classify the Y
chromosome as &quot;haplogroup&quot; R defined by the M207
mutation. The subgroup is R1b1b2a*-128. </font> <a

article with maps etc</a></p>

<p><font size="4">Alexander joined the Northumberland militia in
or before 1777, aged no older than 23. The English militia were
selected from all the population by ballot, but most people who
were chosen paid a substitute to take their place, so Alexander
was probably one of these who took a payment. In peacetime the
militia only had to attend a training camp for a few weeks a
year. Unfortunately for Alexander the militia were called up for
full time service (&quot;embodied&quot;) in March 1778 when it
became known that France had made an alliance with America to
help in the American War of Independance.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">America did not win the War of Independance
alone, but only after France, then Spain and eventually most of
Europe declared war on Britain. The French and Spanish were eager
for revenge after their defeat and losses of territory in the
Seven Years war, and saw their opportunity when the American War
of Independance broke out. The French fleet blockaded Chesapeake
Bay in 1781 forcing the British surrender at Yorktown. Earlier,
in August 1779 a French and Spanish armada sailed into the
English Channel, with 66 ships carrying 30,000 men with the aim
of occupying the Isle of Wight or perhaps Plymouth. Fortunately
the French fleet had had to wait six weeks outside the Spanish
ports waiting for the Spanish fleet to sail, so when they reached
the English Channel the ships were short of supplies and struck
by epidemics, and had to return to port. They hoped to try again
next year, so Britain remained on full invasion alert.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">By September 1779 Alexander's company of the
Northumberland militia was commanded by Captain Hawdon Phillipson
Rowe. There were 9 companies, a total of around 620 officers and
men. The </font><a href="northumberland-militia.htm"><font
size="4">Northumberland militia</font></a><font size="4"> were
ordered to start marching from Newcastle to the East Yorkshire
coast on 15th and 16th June 1779. ( It is a great advantage
having an ancestor who was in the armed forces, so you can trace
his exact movements from the military records). The militia
tended to be posted away from their home county in case they had
to put down any local riots (they would not want to shoot their
friends and neighbours), and to reduce the chance of desertion.
The militia were posted along the coast to help repel a
full-scale invasion or local raids, and take action against armed
smugglers.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Six of the companies of the Northumberland
militia were billeted in Beverley, 2 in Bridlington, and one
scattered along the coast at Hornsea, Skipsea and Mappleton</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="4">Other county militia were guarding the
important city and port of Hull. Most militia in England at this
time were billeted in overcrowded pubs, except those in organised
camps around London.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The York Courant newspaper described a ball
held by the officers of the militia :-</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="4">Nov 16th - We hear from Beverley that Lord
    Algernon Percy and the officers of the Northumberland
    Militia, quartered at that place, Hornsea, and Market
    Weighton, gave a ball to the Ladies and Gentlemen of that
    neighbourhood, which was numerous and extremely brilliant,
    particularly the ladies, who excelled in Taste and Dress any
    Thing behold in those parts before. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><a name="JPJ on family page"></a><font size="4">However, there
was a serious side to the duties of the Northumberland militia.
In September 1779 </font><a href="johnpauljones.htm"><font
size="4">John Paul Jones</font></a><font size="4"> sailed his
fleet down the Yorkshire coast leading to his famous battle with
the British ship Serapis off Flamborough Head. (He is now almost
unheard of in Britain, but his phrase &quot;I have not yet begun
to fight!&quot;, after a four hour battle with his ship almost
destroyed beneath him, is famous in America.).</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The two companies based in Bridlington were on
the front line. The Newcastle Courant printed a letter from
Bridlington:-</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="4">&quot;On Tuesday the 21st inst, about
    eleven o'clock at night, the piquet guard of a detachment of
    the Northumberland militia gave the alarm of several light
    colliers being chased and fired at in the Bay by Paul Jones's
    fleet; upon which the drums were beat to arms, and in less
    than a quarter of an hour both officers and men were upon the
    pier, eager for action in case he should attempt to land; and
    from that time lay every night upon their arms until Paul
    Jones's fleet left this coast. Too much cannot be said of
    Major Surtees, Capt Wood and the other officers, for the
    strict attention they paid the whole time Jones was on the
    coast; their steady adherence to military discipline has
    endeared them very much to the inhabitants of Bridlington and
    the neighbourhood.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4">Another letter from Bridlington dated Sept 28th
gave more details :-</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="4">&quot;When Paul Jones's squadron appeared
    off Bridlington Quay, and had actually threatened the town,
    and shipping which had sheltered themselves in the harbour
    amounting to nearly 40 sail of colliers; the masters were
    requested, for the security of both, to mount their carriage
    cannon on the pier, which might have been done very easily,
    as there were upward of 200 sailors ready to execute the work
    instantly; but not one captain except Captain Greathead of
    the Kitty, would lift a hand. He alone got his cannon mounted
    with the greatest expedition and if the rest had done the
    same, 40 or 50 guns might have been mounted, and brested so
    as to have made a compleat battery.&quot;</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4">A letter from Beverley noted &quot;The two
companies of the Northumberland militia which marched hence from
Bridlington on Wednesday afternoon, returned hither on Friday
morning.&quot; Perhaps my ancestor was in one of these companies,
a small place in history.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">There were similar alarms and hasty
preparations for defense in Hull </font><a
href="defense-of-hull.htm"><font size="4">(details)</font></a></p>

<p><font size="4">I wrote a podcast about these events, that can
be played here </font><a

<p><font size="4">My ancestor's company, commanded by Captain
Hawdon Phillipson Rowe, was moved on 5th October 1779 to Market
Weighton, further inland. This may be because Beverley was rather
overcrowded. Men were usually billeted in overcrowded pubs and
houses. ( After the Northumberland militia were posted down
south, the Mayor of Beverley in May 1780 pleaded for some of the
newly billeted militia to be moved away to ease overcrowding).
The monthly returns give the commanding officer of each company,
and show Captain Rowe's company in Market Weighton from November
onwards. The annual returns of the militia give the number of men
in each company who came from different countries, so in 1779 we
can see Captain Rowe's company including Alexander Cairns had 65
men, of which 58 were from England and 7 were &quot;Scotch&quot;
(11%). None were Irish or foreign. The men in this company were
fairly short, only one was above 5 ft 9 inches.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Alexander married in Market Weighton in
February 1780. His banns of marriage said he was &quot;of the
Northumberland militia, quartered in this parish&quot;, but for
his marriage in the following week he was described as a
labourer, so he presumably left the militia around this date,
having served his full time. He missed the most serious action of
the Northumberland militia, putting down the </font><a

size="4"> in London later this year.</font></p>

children.</font></p>
