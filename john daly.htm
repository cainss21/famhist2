<p><font size="5"><u>John Francis Daly</u></font></p>

<p><font size="3">John Daly was born in December 1893 in London,
the third and youngest son of John and Ceilia Daly. In the 1911
census he was living with his widowed father at 21 Lichfield
Grove, Church End, Finchley, and was working as a shop assistant
at a provisions merchant.</font></p>

hspace="0" width="245" height="376"></font><font size="3">John
enlisted in the 10th battalion of the Essex regiment. 10th Essex
was a K2 volunteer Service battalion which started to form at
Warley, near Brentwood, Essex, in September 1914. The battalion
initially trained at Shorncliffe Downs, living at St Martin's
Plain Camp, Folkestone, where 1,000 strong, they paraded in
civilian clothes; and then at Colchester (Hyderabad Barracks)
where they received Kitchener Blues (Post Office uniforms).</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Just before leaving Essex John married Ethel
Eagle on 3rd April 1915 at St Alban's Roman Catholic Church,
North Finchley. John was based at the Hyderabad barracks in
Colchester. <img src="ethel_eagle_mid_colours.jpg" width="271"
height="371"></font></p>

<p><font size="3">10th Battalion finished their 'battle' training
on the Warminster end of Salisbury Plain, living in camp at
Codford St Mary, Wiltshire, in May and June 1915. They landed at
Boulogne on Monday 26th July 1915. Twenty four hours later they
arrived on the Somme and on the 4th August entered the front line
for the first time, opposite the German held village of Thiepval,
to receive instruction from the 152nd Highland Brigade of the
51st (Highland) Division.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The 10th Essex were one of four infantry
battalions that formed the 53rd Infantry Brigade, itself one of
three Brigades (the others were the 54th and 55th) that made the
infantry arm, the fighting arm, of the 18th (Eastern) Division,
under General Ivor Maxse. So began the 10th Essex&#146;s war.
During the next eleven months, they would hold the line and learn
the art of trench warfare opposite the German held villages of
Mametz, La Boiselle, Fricourt and Montauban on the Somme.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">On 14th March
1916 the Battalion marched from Franvillers to Etineham Camp.
Entering the line on 16th March they held the northern and
eastern edges of Maricourt Wood. Spells in the line and at camp
training continued into April, particular attention being paid to
gas warfare. Several parties were sent out to take samples of the
German wire. In early May the Battalion moved to Longpre, 1'/z
miles NW of Amiens. The whole Battalion were inoculated against
typhoid.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">In prepartion for
the battle of the Somme, an open piece of ground at Bertangles
was used to represent a section of the German line, including
trenches named Mine Alley, Bund Trench, Bund Support, Popoff Lane
and Montauban Alley. Duties were assigned and it appeared
10/Essex would be in support of the first day&#146;s forthcoming
operation. During Divisional training General Maxse laid emphasis
on efficient mopping-up. Hence each support battalion sent
forward a platoon with each assaulting battalion whose task it
was to see that the first position taken was cleared of the
enemy. Other platoons later moved forward to clear communication
trenches, support points in the main attack and carry up
ammunition and generally assist the assaulting battalions. On 3rd
May 10/Essex left Longpre for Corbie. Bn HQ and 2 Coys were at
Bronfay Farm, all Coys were employed in various working parties.
Actual strength of the Battalion at the end of May was 34
Officers and 985 ORs.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><img
src="somme_large_modern_map.jpg" align="left" hspace="0"
width="906" height="864">On 8th June 10/Essex were back in the
line in the Carnoy sector. The Battalion was to capture its first
PoW, this feat was achieved by 2/Lt F B Wearne and three of his
scouts on 10&quot;&#145; June. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The latter part
of June was spent in working parties digging a deep cable trench
between Billon Wood and Maricourt.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The Allied
bombardment began on 24th June and went, initially, virtually
unanswered by the Germans. The Battalion was also using 2&quot;
trench mortars against the German wire. On the same day Bn HQ
moved to Carnoy. On 25th June the trench mortars were again in
use and two German observation balloons were brought down on the
Battalion front by incendiary bombs dropped from aircraft. During
26th June smoke was used during the bombardment. At dusk that day
10/Essex were relieved by 8/Norfolks and were billeted in Billon
Wood. There was a CO&#146;s conference on 27th June and on 28th
June came the news that operations had been postponed for 48
hours. The Battalion suffered retaliatory fire whilst in Billon
Wood, on both 28th and 29th June. Gas shells were used by the
enemy and two 10/Essex men were wounded. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">During 30th June
advance parties moved up to Carnoy, followed later in the day by
the rest of the Battalion, which took up positions in the
trenches of the Carnoy defences. Burrows reports that the men
were in good spirits and that they were eager for the offensive
to begin, replacing the monotony of trench duty. Each man was
equipped with two grenades and extra ammunition.</p>

substantial breakfast of hot tea and rum, bacon, and bully beef.
The battalion went into action with approximately 645 rifles
(excluding Lewis gun teams).</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The 18 Division
attack, on the left of XIII Corps, started well. A series of
mines (the largest 5,000 pounds, several others around 500
pounds) were blown under the German front line at 7.27 a.m.
&#150; three minutes before zero. In all, nine dugouts were
destroyed along with many of their garrisons. In addition eight
&#145;Russian&#146; saps (shallow trenches dug across no man's
land) containing machine-guns and flame-projectors were employed
to enfilade the German line or incinerate those trench-dwellers
who survived the bombardment.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Nevertheless, all
did not go well. In the area of <strong>53 Brigade</strong>, some
German guns had survived the counter-battery onslaught and
managed to inflict heavy casualties on British troops as they
huddled in their assembly trenches. The results were particularly
grisly, as one observer later noted:</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&#145;Our men
were lying dead in [the assembly trench], killed by the enemy's
shells. In one place a man was kneeling, as if in prayer, his
hands covering his face. Lying in the trench behind him was
another man, face downwards, half buried in the earth thrown into
the trench by the shells. A short distance away another man was
sitting on the fire-step, buried to the knees, and looking as if
he had suddenly turned to stone. A little further along the
trench I stepped on something, and looking down I saw a piece of
a man's backbone, and pieces of flesh strewn about the trench.
Hanging down from the parapet, in the comer of the traverse, was
a mass of entrails, already swarming with flies. And so on, here
and there along the trench, wherever the enemy shells had dropped
in.&#146; It is worth noting that the <strong>53 brigade</strong>
report described the enemy&#146;s barrage in this area as
&#145;not heavy&#146;.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><u>Kasino Point
mine</u></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The Kasino Point
machine gun post was located between the villages of Mametz,
Carnoy and Montauban. It was marked out for special attention by
British planners as it was a heavily defended position. Kasino
Point mine was one of seven large mines that were due to be
detonated at 7:28 a.m. on 1 July. During the tunnelling operation
to place the 5,000 lb (2,300 kg) mine the British accidentally
broke through one of the German dugouts. The British were able to
cover up where they broke through. During this operation the mine
was not placed properly.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">At 7:28 a.m. all
but two of the mines exploded, one of the two was the Hawthorn
Ridge mine which was detonated at 7:20 a.m., the other was the
Kasino Point mine. Just before the Royal Engineers were about to
detonate the Kasino Point mine the British troops left their
trenches and began walking across No Man's Land. The officer in
charge was in a dilemma and didn't detonate the mine immediately.
As the British crossed No Man's Land they started taking fire
from the machine gun post at Kasino Point, inflicting many
casualties. At this stage the R.E. officer decided to detonate
the mine, blowing several machine gun posts sky-high.
Unfortunately because the mine had not been placed properly, the
debris did not fall back into the crater as it should have.
Instead the debris was blasted over a wide area causing many
casualties among at least four British battalions.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">L/Cpl E. J.
Fisher of the <strong>10th Essex </strong>was crossing No Man's
Land at the time;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">'I looked left to
see if my men were keeping a straight line. I saw a sight I shall
never forget. A giant fountain, rising from our line of men,
about 100 yards from me. Still on the move I stared at this, not
realizing what it was. It rose, a great column nearly as high as
Nelson's Column, then slowly toppled over. Before I could think,
I saw huge slabs of earth and chalk thudding down, some with
flames attached, onto the troops as they advanced'</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The late
detonation took all the German units by surprise allowing the
British to sweep over the German trenches, making it the most
successful mine detonation of the 1st July offensive.<br>
<br>
These men were from 2 platoons of number 2 and 3 companies of the
10th Essex which were attached to the 8th Norfloks and 6th Royal
Berks. John Daly was in number 1 company, = A company, so not one
of these men.<br>
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><u>Advance </u></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">On the right of
the attack facing 55 Brigade, German machine- gunners in a
cratered section of no man&#146;s land survived the British
bombardment, machine-guns, and flame-throwers. They inflicted
heavy casualties on the leading waves of the brigade and
effectively brought the attack in this section of the front to a
halt.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Luckily for 18
Division, the experience of the 54 Brigade, and of the large
section of <strong>53 Brigade </strong>which had escaped the
early attentions of the German artillery, was quite different.
These brigades, aided by the confusion caused by the mines, had
captured the German front line shortly after 7.30 a.m. Following
the creeping barrage, and with only scattered opposition, they
progressed rapidly through the support line and rearward trenches
of the German front system. So rapid was their progress that most
of the strong Pommiers Trench was in their hands by 8.15 a.m. By
8.30 they had advanced 1,000 yards in total and were closing on
Pommiers Redoubt. There they encountered their first setback. The
wire in front of the redoubt had not been adequately cut and the
attack halted. It took them half an hour to cut their way through
(&#145;a nightmare for years to come,&#146; according to one
participant). Even when the wire was cut the enemy garrison in
the redoubt fought on, prepared, as the Bedfords noted, &#145;to
defend this last vital point in their line to the last&#146;. It
was at this point that the meticulous training given to the
troops by General Maxse, and their familiarity with the German
trench layout from the realistic models constructed during
training, paid dividends. Parties of troops simultaneously swung
to the left and right flanks of the redoubt. From the left it was
found, a rnachine-gun could enfilade the front face of the German
position. Some other troops, in contrast, tried to assault from
the rear only to be fired on by German troops in a trench behind
the redoubt. However, they turned about, charged that trench,
subdued the defenders, turned about again, and captured the rear
face of Pommiers. By then other troops were entering the trench
fortress from all sides. By 9.30 a.m. the formidable Pommiers
Redoubt was in British hands.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">All this action,
and the final subduing of the German garrison in the cratered
area at 9.30 a.m., relieved the pressure on 55 Brigade, which, as
related earlier, had been brought to a halt. The survivors of the
leading battalions of this brigade, reinforced by their support
battalions, were now able to advance on their final objective
(Montauban Alley just to the north-west of the village). All went
smoothly until they reached a trench halfway towards their
objective. There some German riflemen and machine-gunners put up
a considerable resistance which failed only when they were
outflanked by a party led by the intrepid Lt Tortoise of the
Queen&#146;s battalion. At this point German resistance in front
of 55 brigade finally crumbled and the brigade was able to link
hands with the <strong>53 brigade</strong> on its left and troops
of the 30 division on its right.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">All objectives in
front of the 18 division had fallen. On the left elements of the
54 brigade were holding positions some 500 yards beyond Pommiers
redoubt and in the centre patrols had even been sent forward to
Caterpillar Wood which lay beyond the final objectives. The wood
was found to be empty but as evening was now falling and German
shelling growing heavier it was prudently decided to consolidate
Montauban Alley and await the new day.<font size="3"> The Gernans
strongly counterattacked on the 2nd to try to recapture Montaban
village, but with no success.<br>
---------</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="3">John
Daly was in A company. However, in the 10th Essex diary the
companies are numbered 1 to 4, so presumably John Daly was in 1
company. In the orders for 1st July, companies 2 3 and 4 were
assigned to the attack but number 1 company was assigned to carry
small arms and bomb ammunition forward. There is no mention of
number 1 company throughout the 1st July, so it seems they were
not in the front line.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="3">On
the evening of 3rd July 10/Essex were warned to prepare to take
Caterpillar Wood. This wood comprised a strip of land, covered in
trees and running parallel with the British Front Line. It could
not be seen from the Allied trenches, however, as it lay on a
steep slope. The order stated that the task must be completed by
4.30am on 4th July. The operation began at 2.52am and was
completed by 3.20am, no opposition having been encountered. An
outpost was taken on the southern edge of the wood and from this
vantage point sentries had a good field of view over the southern
edge of Mametz Wood to the left, the approach to Bazantin on the
ridge ahead and the valley to the right. Five abandoned guns were
found. During the day bombing parties moved forward and
established a post in Marlborough Wood. Companies 2 and 4 were
used for this attack.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="3">On
the night of 4th/5th, 1 and 3 companies relieved the 7th Buffs at
Mine Alley, Back Trench and Breslau Alley.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="3">The
battalion held the line until the 7th when they were relieved and
sent back to Bronfay farm, then to Grovetown camp some 4km SW of
Carnoy ( just south of the modern airfield) until the 14th.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="3">On
the 9th they had congratulatory messages, church parade, the
Divisional General visted, and they refitted. On the 10th numbers
1 and 4 coys bathed in the Somme down at Etinehem. </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="3">It
seems strange that the successful attack on the first day was not
followed up immediately, giving the Germans time to bring in
reinforcements and dig new trench lines. A major set-piece battle
was planned for the 14th, advancing north to the ridge running
from the Bazentin villages to Longueval and Delville Wood. (
Before this, it was neccessary to capture Bernafay Wood and
Trones Wood on the right flank. After 7 unsuccessful attacks from
the 8th to 13th, Trones Wood was finally captured by the 18th
division on the 14th July, and there is a memorial to them at the
southern edge of the wood. The 53rd brigade were not involved in
this attack.). </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="3">On
the 14th, John Daly's number 1 company were ordered up Longueval
Alley to NE corner of Bernafay Wood. There is a full description
of 1 company during the 14th.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><img
src="14july%20map%20colour.jpg" align="left" hspace="0"
width="649" height="589">The attack of 14th July went very well
after a short accurate barrage and the troops had crept close to
the enemy front line in the dark. Some troops reached High Wood,
well beyond the objectives, and even the Indian cavalry made a
brief attack. But High Wood was not finally taken until 15th
September after many desperate battles. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">However only a
small part of Delville Wood and the village of Longueval were
captured on the 14th July, and the Germans were able to fire
machine guns from the wood and from cellars in the village, so
there were more attempts to capture it. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="3">Woods
were vital areas to capture, because enemy troops could fire from
concealed positions in the woods, and move under cover. However
it was very difficult to dig trenches through the tree roots, so
the opposition could pour artillary shells into the woods and the
soldiers inside were unable to take cover. Advancing through a
wood was also very difficult due to all the fallen trees. </font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><font size="4"><strong><u>Battle
of Delville Wood</u></strong></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">This was the most
difficult part of the front, the very apex of the right angle.
Here it was essential that German forces and batteries to left
and right be distracted by simultaneous attacks so they could not
bring murderous fire on the attacking troops from three
directions. Yet on most occasions, no such supporting operations
were mounted. This meant that even when some progress was made,
as it was by the South African Brigade on the 15th, retention of
the captured ground proved impossible. Great groups of German
batteries on the three sides of the wood poured a deluge of
shells into the newly won areas, followed by German
counter-attacks (delivered by fresh troops) which forced the
South Africans back to their original positions. Some South
African were forced into the south-east corner of the wood, cut
off and eventually had to surrender.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Between 18 and 23
July repeated attempts were made to capture the wood and village
of Longueval. Troops from four divisions were consumed in these
attacks. On the same day that Congreve, who had been present at
Rawlinson&#146;s conference of corps commanders, heard his chief
announce that the time for isolated attacks was now over, he
received instructions from Fourth Army headquarters ordering him
to capture Delville Wood at all costs and without delay.&#147; In
other words, isolated attacks were being ordered by the same
commander who earlier had announced that they should cease.<br>
Haig contributed nothing meaningful in this period. To start with
he seemed to favour operations against Delville Wood, on the
grounds that it commanded the German line around Guillemont to
the south. Then he changed his mind and decided that operations
against Guillemont could proceed without the capture of Delville
Wood. After that he then instructed Rawlinson to broaden his
front and include High Wood in any future attacks. In the end
nothing of this signified. Rawlinson continued to blast away at
Delville Wood and Guillemont and High Wood as though Haig had
never spoken. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The 10th Essex
battalion was billeted in Billon Wood until, at 7.00pm on 18th
July, orders were received to move to Carnoy. Once it arrived at
Carnoy the Battalion was told to be ready to move at a moments
notice.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">In the early
morning of 19th July l0/Essex received urgent orders to report to
Brigade Rendezvous in Caterpillar Valley, this order coming after
two days of orders and cancellations. By 4.30pm the Battalion lay
in artillery formation on the right of the Montauban-Longueval

wood to the north of Princes Street 1 company taking the section
from Bond Street to Regent Street. A and D Coys of 10/Essex moved
off at 5.45am, B Coy to follow at an interval of 120yds, C Coy
were in reserve. At 10.10am part of A Coy were supporting
8/Norfolks, Lt-Col Scott went into the wood and was very soon
hit. Later in the day at about 4.00pm he was carried to Bernafay
Wood by the Padre. A and D Coys, now commanded by Lt-Col Clay
(8/Norfolks) were ordered into the wood but were to remain south
of Princes Street. From 3.30pm onwards three attempts were made
to move north of Princes Street, but enemy fire and Bbritish
artillery made this impossible. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The Divisional
History notes:<br>
&#147;The hand-to-hand fighting between small parties of men was
of so desperate a nature, and the German attacks were so
persistent, that non-combatant Chaplain David Randall, who was
with Col Scott and the Bn HQ party, armed himself with a rifle to
be ready for all emergencies. &quot;<br>
At 5.10pm orders were received to consolidate and hold the line
of Princes Street. This was carried out by approximately 250 men,
a reserve also being held in the south of the wood to
counter-attack should this prove necessary. At one point in the
night Sgt Maj Mercer perceived Bn HQ to be under threat and
deployed servants, signallers and runners to defend it.<br>
10/Essex took over a line from the junction of King Street and
South Street to the eastern end of Princes Street early on the
morning of 20th July. During the following night A, B and D Coys
were relieved, C Coy was required to remain and reinforce 4/R
Fusiliers who had been so adversely effected by casualties it
could not man the whole sector. C Coy remained in the line for
another 24 hours during which some further hard fighting took
place.<br>
During this short, but bloody, action three officers were killed,
19 others were wounded. 75 ORs<br>
were killed, 38 were missing and 402 wounded. </p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Delville Wood was
not finally captured until 25th August after the Germans had
repeatedly retaken the wood and then been forced out. By the end
of the battle only one tree was left standing.</p>

----------------------------</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The History
notes:<br>
&quot;Our men were wonderful. The majority of all ranks who went
into Delville Wood were &#145;original &#146; 10th Essex. It was
a very meagre skeleton that came out... The <strong>53rd Infantry
Brigade</strong> 's counter-attack on Delville Wood was the most
miserable and at the same time most costly operation in which the
Battalion took part during the time I was serving with it, and I
believe no one will contradict me if I say that the Battalion
never again played a part in any battle anything like so
unsatisfactory as this.&quot;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The lower-order
commanders who participated in these operations were quite aware
of the futility of their endeavours. General Higginsons' <strong>53
Brigade</strong> (18 Division) suffered severely in Delville Wood
on 17 (?) July and he wrote a bitter report in which he compared
this operation unfavourably with his brigade&#146;s successful
operation on 1 July. The attack on the first day of campaigning,
he noted, was characterised by: careful attention to all details
of the attack; artillery preparation and wire-cutting; and
co-operation of the artillery with the infantry in the attack.
The latter operation, by contrast, was characterised by:
insufficient time for careful consideration of plans;
insufficient time for artillery preparation; difficulty of
communication with battalions; lack of co-operation between
artillery and infantry; difficulty of obtaining accurate
information about the situation; intense hostile artillery
bombardment and machine-gun fire; lack of co-operation with
neighbouring units; and (perhaps most damningly) the fact that
the attack was not launched until 45 minutes after the artillery
bombardment had ceased.&#148;</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">Eighteen years
later Higginson&#146;s indignation is still manifest in a letter
he wrote to Edmonds complaining about the description of this
attack in the draft Official History:<br>
&quot;The account . .. does not bring out a very important point,
namely that this attack was carried out at such short notice that
no previous reconnaissance or adequate preparations were possible
and there was no time to arrange any effective fire plan. When it
received orders to move the Bde was in bivouac at Talus Bois and
was not expecting to be engaged immediately. In my opinion this
attack demonstrated the futility of such hastily considered and
ill-prepared attacks. At the time I thought that XIII Corps made
a grave mistake in not allowing sufficient time for its
preparation and I am even more firmly of that opinion today . . .
.I notice that the Official History does not comment on the
wisdom or otherwise of attacks such as this. The failure of these
attacks was not due to lack of determination on the part of the
troops: the units of the <strong>53rd Bde</strong> were in great
form after their successes of the 1st July and their morale was
high . . . I know it is extremely difficult in an account of
operations of so great magnitude . .. to give more than a bare
outline but if you can bring to light the hasty nature of the
attack I will feel that the official account does justice to my
old Brigade.&#147;<br>
