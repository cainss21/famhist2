<p><font size="4">Joined as a &quot;Boy 2&quot; in 1915, training
at HMS Ganges and Pembroke I until September 1915.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Joined HMS Conquest in Sept 1915, a newly-built
light cruiser in the Harwich flottila. He probably saw action on
24th April 1916 when 4 German battlecruisers and six light
cruisers attacked Lowestoft. HMS Conquest was the flagship of
Admiral Tyrwhitt; he approached the German fleet hoping to lure
them away from Lowestoft. The German battlecruisers opened fire
and badly damaged the Conquest, there were 40 dead and wounded.

<p><font size="4">There was a family story that he fought at
Jutland on 31st May 1916. But HMS Conquest doesn't seem to have
been in this battle, the Harwich flottila was held in reserve
until after the battle in case any of the German navy broke off
and made an attack in this direction. See </font><a

size="4">Order of Battle - Battle of Jutland - 31 May to 1 June
1916</font></a><font size="4"> , go to section 3, Harwich
flotilla. Gilbert may have actually been referring to the battle
off Lowestoft just a month before.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">He was still on the Conquest on 13th June 1918
when it hit a mine near Chatham during gunnary practice. 7 men
were killed and 15 wounded. Gilbert was commended for bravery
during the emergency. </font></p>
