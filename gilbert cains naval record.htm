<p><font size="4"><u>Gilbert Cains Naval record</u></font></p>

<p><font size="4">Called Bertie on his birth certificate and
Naval record, but always called Gilbert by the family.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Here is his naval record from the National
Archives at Kew</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font size="4">Joined as a &quot;Boy 2&quot; in 1915, training
at HMS Ganges and Pembroke I until September 1915.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Joined HMS Conquest in Sept 1915, a newly-built
light cruiser in the Harwich flottila. He probably saw action on
24th April 1916 when 4 German battlecruisers and six light
cruisers attacked Lowestoft. HMS Conquest was the flagship of
Commodore Tyrwhitt; he approached the German fleet hoping to lure
them away from Lowestoft. The German battlecruisers opened fire
and badly damaged the Conquest, there were 40 dead and wounded.

<p><font size="4">HMS Conquest was not fully taken out of service
but just had short periods of time out for repairs, and remained
active with the Harwich flotilla. Gilbert always said that he had
been at the battle of Jutland just a month later. He <u>almost</u>
was, but not quite.... </font></p>

<p><font size="4">On 31st May 1916 at around 2pm, the British
Grand Fleet met the German High Seas fleet in the North Sea, west
of Jutland, and fighting continued all night. At 5.25pm the
Harwich flotilla sailed out under Commodore Tyrwitt, apparently
without any orders from the Admiralty ? At 6pm they were ordered
to turn around and return to port, probably because the Admiralty
thought the Germans might try another coastal raid while the bulk
of the Royal Navy were occupied at Jutland. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Admiral Jellicoe had a signal at 3am next
morning, 1st June, suggesting that the German fleet had got past
the Royal Navy in the night, and would be able to get back to
their ports. At 5am the Harwich flotilla was ordered to sail out
and help the surviving Navy ships back to port. The flotilla
escorted the battleship Marlborough which had been torpodoed,
back to the Humber. </font><a

<p><font size="4">Gilbert was still on the Conquest on 13th June
1918 when it hit a mine near Chatham during gunnary practice. 7
men were killed and 15 wounded. Gilbert was commended for bravery
during the emergency. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Gilbert then spent about 3 weeks at the HMS
Pembroke base, ( and hopefully some leave ? ) before transferring
to a cruiser HMS Dragon on 10th August 1918. The First World War
was over in 3 months, but that was not the last of Gilbert's
experience of battle. One of the terms of the Nov 1918 armistice
was that a German army could stay in the Baltic states and help
defends them from the Bolsheviks. They were joined by White
Russians </font><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Russian_Volunteer_Army"><font
size="4">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Russian_Volunteer_Army</font></a><font
size="4"> who were able to repel the Bolsheviks, but then tried
to defeat the new Baltic states' armies and occupy the states,
which had historically been part of the Prussian lands. The
situation was very confused, see for example General Alexander's
part in this </font><a

<p><font size="4">The British government wanted to help the
Baltic states gain independance, so sent the Royal Navy in to
oppose the German &quot;private army&quot;. HMS Conquest sailed
from Sheerness towards Riga on 10th October 1918, and they were
in the Baltic till the 30th December. They bombarded the German
forces around Riga on many days from 15th October to 10th
November, but on the 17th October two shells from the shore hit
HMS Dragon, killing 9 men. The ship's log for Aug 1919 to July
1921 is here </font><a

<p><font size="4">Gilbert finally left the navy on 22nd Dec 1922,
married in 1927 and moved to near Whitby, where he had a long
life growing prize-winning fruit and veg, and running a seaside
holiday boarding-house with his wife. He died in 1974.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">HMS Dragon ended her days in July 1944
bombarding the Normandy battlefields until she was hit by a
German manned torpedo, and was then sunk as part of the
Arromanches artificial harbour.</font></p>
