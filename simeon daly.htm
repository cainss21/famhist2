<p><font size="5"><u>Simeon Thomas Daly ( &quot;Tim&quot;)</u></font></p>

<p><font size="3">Simeon Thomas Daly was born 18th Feb 1890 in
Kensington, the second son of John Daly and Cecilia Targett. He
was usually known as Thomas, and the family called him Tim. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">For his family history, see here </font><a
href="daly%20intro.htm">Return to Daly brothers home page.</a></p>

<p><font size="3">From his service number 8283 we know he joined
the West Yorkshire regiment between 3rd and 7th January 1907,
probably signing on for 7 years so expecting to leave the army in
1914, but it was not to be. In the April 1911 census he was
already a corporal in the 3rd battalion of the West Yorkshire
regiment at the Fulford barracks in York. It is not obvious why a
young lad from North London would join the West Yorkshire
regiment.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">He married Sarah Louise Wise, from York, on
24th July 1911.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On 29th March 1912, during a national coal
miners strike, the newspaper &quot;The Northern Whig&quot;
reported that 500 men of the 1st West Yorkshire regiment were
sent from Litchfield to Littleton Colliery, Cannock, a distance
of around 13 miles, arriving at 2am, so it sounds like an urgent
request. Actually they may have come from the Whittington
barracks near Litchfield.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On Sept 28th 1912 the Staffordshire Advertiser
reported that the 1st battalion of the West Yorkshires were based
at Whittington Barracks, and had their annual athletics event on
the Heath. Sergeant Daly came second in the 220 yards sergeants
handicap race. Whittington is 3 miles SE of Litchfield in
Staffordshire, the barracks are about a mile SW of the village.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">There are historical pictures of the barracks
with descriptions </font><a

size="3">here</font></a><font size="3"> . The barracks still
exist and are still being used today.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">At the end of 1913 he passed out of the School
of Musketry at Hythe with a distinguished grade.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><img src="army%20gazette%201913.jpg"
width="771" height="578"></font></p>

<p><font size="3">There is a 10 minute radio clip about the
Musketry School in WW1 here </font><a
href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p01wsb1y"><font size="3">https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p01wsb1y</font></a>
.The school was particularly to teach officers and NCOs how to
train other men.</p>

<p>These photos from the Imperial War Musuem collection show the
Hythe school in 1915.</p>

<p><font size="3">The school of musketry is shown on this 1908
map, with numerous rifle ranges marked out to the south, ranges
up to 2,000 yards.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">-----------------</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In 1914 he is in a photo of the 1st battalion
at Lichfield, at the bottom right corner. Notice almost every
single man has a moustache ! Photo kindly supplied by the York
Army Museum, donated by the Prince of Wales' Own ( West Yorkshire
Regiment) in 2008. The photo description says Litchfield, but
perhaps this was also at the Whittington barracks near
Litchfield.</font></p>

<p>The crossed rifles and crown on his upper right arm indicate
that he was a sergeant instructor in musketry, and probably the
partially obscured skill at arms badge on his lower left arm is
crossed rifles within a wreath, surmounted by a star which would
indicate best shot in the battalion.</p>

<p><font size="3">After WW1 broke out </font>Simeon was billeted
at Whitburn army camp whilst acting as a musketry instructor.
Whitburn was in County Durham, and is now incorporated into the
county of Tyne &amp; Wear. The 3rd batallion were assigned to
coastal defense.</p>

<p>-------------------</p>

<p><font size="3">They had two children :- my grandmother
Kathleen ( known as Kay ) in 1912 and Thomas in 1914. </font></p>

<p>This photo shows Sarah, Thomas, Kay and Simeon, must have been
end of 1914 or very early 1915.</p>

<p><font size="3">The Newcastle Daily Journal of May 24th 1915
recorded that Colour Sergeant S.T. Daly of the 3rd battalion West
Yorks took part in a military sports day at the Horsley Hill
football ground in South Shields. He won two rounds to get
through to the finals of the 100 yards flat race for NCOs and
men, and came third in the final, close up to the winner. He also
won a heat of the 120 yards flat race for Sergeants. Another
newspaper talking about the same event said that &quot;For
individual ability, the leading honours were appropriated by the
3rd West Yorkshire Regiment, through the medium of the
magnificent feats of Colour-Sergeant Daly&quot; ( ... and 3
others ). &quot;Colour-Sergeant Daly of the 3rd West Yorks ranked
as the most successful pedestrian&quot; ( any race on foot).
&quot;He won the 100 yards, the sergeants 220 yards and the
quarter-mile flat scratch events in dashing style&quot;. The
event was even reported as far away as Sheffield </font></p>

<p><font size="3">---------------</font></p>

<p><font size="3">The 3rd battalion stayed in the UK throughout
the war as a training battalion as part of the Tyne garrison. We
do not know exactly when Simeon transferred to active service,
but he was already in France when he </font><a
href="john%20daly.htm"><font size="3">wrote to John Daly's
commanding officer</font></a><font size="3"> to ask more about
his death on 20th July 1916. </font>Family lore has it that
Simeon had a perfectly safe UK posting and could have remained
there for the duration but, upon hearing of the death of his
brother, asked for an active service posting to revenge his
brother's death. Presumably this was why he transferred to the
12th battalion. </p>

<p><strong>On 19th August 1916 the 12th battalion diary records
&quot;Reg Sgt Daly reported for duty&quot;</strong>. He had
written his will 3 days earlier, on the 16th. At this time they
were in action at Guillemont on the Somme, only about a mile from
where his brother had died one month ago. So at the age of only
26 he was already the Regimental Sergeant Major.</p>

<p><font size="3">( The 12th ( Service ) battalion of the West
Yorkshire Regiment were formed at York on 16 September 1914 as
part of K3 and came under orders of 63rd Brigade, 21st Division.<br>
In September 1915 they were landed at Le Havre and on 16 November
1915 transferred to 9th Brigade, 3rd Division. )</font></p>

<p><font size="3">During the autumn, winter and the spring of
1917 the battalion spent much of the time away from the front
line, but spent some times in trenches around Serre, just north
of the Somme battlefields, and Courcelles between Arras and the
Somme, with 1 or 2 men killed every day by shelling. At the end
of January 1917 they marched to the area north-west of Arras and
were then training continuously until mid-February when they
marched into Arras. They held trenches in front of Arras for two
weeks, then on 1st April moved 8 miles west to Wanquetin for 3
days in &quot;rest billets preparing for the forthcoming
operations&quot;.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">-----------------------</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><strong>The battle of Arras</strong> was the
British and Canadian Army's planned spring offensive for 1917,
but unfortunately the weather was as bad as the middle of winter.
The best known part of this battle was the capture of Vimy ridge
by the Canadians, but the part of the battle fought by Simeon
Daly's division is known as the first battle of the Scarpe. The
whole battle was designed to draw German reinforcements away from
the Aisne sector further south before the French attacked on
April 15th, but many of the French soldiers here mutinied and
refused to go over the top. The battle of Arras was continued to
at least the 4th May, to cover the French.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">On 4th April the battalion marched 8 miles east
from billets in Wanquetin to Arras. For 3 nights they stayed in
cellars under ruined houses in Arras. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">In preparation for the battle, the New Zealand
tunneling company and others had connected several underground
quarries, and joined the tunnels up to the Crincron Sewer to make
safe underground routes for soldiers to advance to the front. The
12th West Yorks' diary gives the route that they followed on the
8th April :-</font></p>

of guided tour</a></p>

<p>The tour passes by the end of the tunnel joining Wellington to
Auckland quarry.</p>

<p>This map shows the creeping barrage on the opening day, moving
forward every 4 minutes from the front line to Tilloy les
Moufflines (bottom right)</p>

<p>The map below shows the 9th brigade's attacks during the
battle. The attack initially was very sucessful. The 76th brigade
captured the Black line, then the 12th West Yorks passed through
at 7am, and by 8.30am had already captured the whole of the
village of Tilloy les Mofflaines. This batallion alone captured 3
machine guns, plus trench morters, boxes of ammunition etc.</p>

<p><img src="9th%20brigade%20map.jpg" width="1011" height="583"></p>

<p>During the 10th April they were consolidating the line and
carrying ammunition up. <font size="3">The battalion diary notes
&quot;the weather was extremely cold with snow showers and the
Battalion spent a most trying and miserable time in this location
without shelter of any description&quot;.</font> On the evening
of the 11th they marched up to occupy trenches at the Brown line,
south of the Cambrai Road, east of Les Foss farm. On the 12th
they cleared up this line. Meanwhile other units were moving up
from the south-west, and captured the village of Wancourt on the
12th.</p>

<p>On the 13th they were ordered to attack east to take Guemappe.
A message was received from the 50th division that they were
&quot;i<strong>n possession of the high ground east of Wancourt
tower</strong>&quot;, but could not advance further until
Guemappe was taken. This high ground overlooked the planned
attack to Guemappe from the south, so the Germans would be able
to fire into the flank of the attack ( enfilade) if they still
had the high ground.. The 50th divison diary says that the
message came from the 151st infantry brigade at 12.55pm. The
151st diary says the message came from 9th DLI, and said a patrol
was digging in 50 yards east of the Tower. ( So certainly not all
&quot;the high ground&quot;). </p>

<p>But only 5 minutes later at 1pm the 151st diary says that two
companies of the DLI failed to reach the tower as they came under
heavy machine gun fire. Then it says they dug in 50 yards west of
the tower, and <u>not </u>east. ( The not is underlined in the
diary). So it sounds like at least some error in the message
there, <strong>the troops were 100 yards short of where they were
reported</strong>.</p>

<p>Simeon's 9th brigade diary during the afternoon shows they had
serious doubts about attacking past the Wancourt Tower. From 2pm
to 5pm the battalions were told it was very unlikely the attack
would happen because the 50th division could not be seen
attacking along the ridge. At 4pm the division were told that the
Germans were still clearly in possession of the high ground south
of Guemappe. But at 4.50pm they got orders that the attack should
be carried out at 7pm. At 5.40pm another message came from the
50th div claiming that they had the high ground south of Guemappe
and were going to advance north at 6.40pm, so the 9th brigade
should be co-operating with this.</p>

<p>The attack was actually launched at 6pm, perhaps aiming to
reach the objective at 7pm. The artillery barrage fired from
6.20pm and lifted at 6.44pm. The 12th West Yorks diary says
&quot;every endeavour was made to push on but the enemy's line
was too strong. After dark they were instructed to
withdraw&quot;. The 3rd division history gives the reason, <strong>when
the West Yorkshires advanced on Guemappe they were exposed to
devasting flanking fire from Wancourt Tower, where Germans were
seen standing in the open to fire across the valley</strong>.&quot;</p>

<p>12 other ranks were killed, including Simeon Daly, due to this
tragic error of communication. The attack went ahead despite the
obvious observations of the Germans still overlooking the attack.</p>

<p>He was initially buried in an isolated cemetary south of the
main road, at the blue dot above the number 10.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then the bodies were concentrated at Wancourt cemetary, on the
south-east side of the village, he is buried in area IV, row E11
in the graveyard.. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Simeon's widow only started receiving a pension 6 months
later, a weekly pension of 21s 3d, plus 9s 2d for the 2 children,
starting on 29th October 1917. She also got a sum of £29 14s 9d,
presumably Simeon's savings, not paid until 28th Dec 1917, and
£25 10s as a war gratuity on 19th November 1919, both listed in
the &quot;soldier's effects register&quot;.</p>

<p>His sister Ethel visited his grave soon after the war, when
there were just wooden crosses. I visited with my family in 1999,
the picture shows Simeon's great-great grandson Jonathon.</p>

<p>In 2014 we managed to have a big family visit to the grave
during an escorted holiday. So the photo shows me ( Simeon's
great grand-son), Mum, (grand-daughter), Dad (grandson-in-law),
my son Jonathon (great great grand-son), and Geoff (great
grand-son).</p>

mentioned in &quot;Walking Arras&quot;, by Paul Reed, published
by Pen and Sword, in the section describing Wancourt cemetary,
page 187. Jim Smithson is also preparing a guide book including
the photo of Ethel at the grave.</font></p>
