<p><font size="4"><u>Family of Andrew Cains</u></font></p>

<p><font size="4">Andrew Cains was born 26th January 1842 in
Everingham, south of Pocklington in East Yorkshire. His parents
were Francis Cains, agricultural labourer, and Hannah ( nee
Hardesty). Francis Cains' ancestors back to 1780 are shown here :

Most of Francis's relations and descendants remained in East
Yorkshire for several generations.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Andrew can be followed through the censuses :-</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In 1851 still living with his parents in
Everingham, aged 9.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In 1861 living at 49 Market Place in Market
Weighton, East Yorkshire. He was living alone except for a
lodger, and working as a blacksmith. He gave his age as 24 which
doesn't quite fit, ( should have been 19) but he did say he was
born in Everingham, so seems to be the right person.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Andrew Cains married Esther Embley on May 8th
1865 in Flamstead near Redbourn ( between Luton and St Albans),
Hertfordshire. Andrew's place of residence on the marriage
certificate is given as Stepney in London. Esther was residing in
Flamstead. Andrew's occupation was farrier ( making horseshoes).
The rest of the Cains family stayed in East Yorkshire for
generations; I really cannot guess why Andrew moved from East
Yorkshire all the way to London at this time. Why should London
should offer better prospects for a blacksmith ? But this was the
move that led to a large extended Cains family in Hertfordshire,
all descended from Andrew Cains.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">They had at least 10 children :-</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="4">Andrew Cains born 1867 in Bethnal Green,
        London.</font><ul>
            <li><font size="4">Andrew married Teresa Ann Pears in
                Pocklington in Q4 1898. In the 1901 census they
                were living in Hull with their first child Mary
                Ann aged 1. They had a son Bernard Pears Cains
                born in 2nd Sept 1903 at 108 Sharp Street,
                Sculcoates near Hull. I have contacted Bernard's
                grandson Andrew. I am not sure what brought
                Andrew back to Pocklington, where he met his
                wife. Perhaps visiting his Dad's family ?</font></li>

                and had at least 8 children. One of these was
                Charles Cains who became Chief Inspector with
                Luton police. His grand-daughter is Lesley Cains
                now living in Australia.</font></li>
