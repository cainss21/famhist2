</blockquote>

<p><font size="4">There are thousands of webpages of advice for
tracing a family tree. For Great Britain, </font><a
href="http://www.genuki.org.uk/"><font size="4">Genuki</font></a><font
size="4"> is a good place to start.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">For the UK I would also recommend </font><a
href="http://www.ancestry.co.uk/"><font size="4">http://www.ancestry.co.uk/</font></a><font
size="4"> , as frequently seen on the BBC series </font><a
href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/familyhistory/"><font size="4">&quot;Who
do you think you are&quot;</font></a><font size="4">. They do
charge a subscription fee, but they have all the UK census
information from 1841 to 1911 ( can search using indexes but
there are a few errors in this, you need to be inventive trying
to get round the copying mistakes). </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Indexes to England and Wales birth marriage and
death certificates can be found at </font><a
href="http://www.freebmd.org.uk/"><font size="4">http://www.freebmd.org.uk</font></a><font
size="4">/ . For a marriage, you can find out for free who the
person married by clicking the page number, it shows the spouse
who is listed on the same page. Otherwise you would need to then
order the certificate to get the information you need ( parent's
details etc). These can be ordered from ancestry.co.uk , or the
General Registry office </font><a
href="http://www.gro.gov.uk/gro/content/certificates/"><font
size="4">http://www.gro.gov.uk/gro/content/certificates/</font></a><font
size="4"> . For Scottish records, the official site is </font><a
href="http://www.scotlandspeople.gov.uk/"><font size="4">Official
government source for Scottish genealogy, census and family
research - ScotlandsPeople</font></a></p>

<p><font size="4">If you can get back to 1837, the Mormons
(Seventh day adventists) have copied and catalogued church birth
and marriage records, which can be searched on the web for free
here </font><a
href="http://www.familysearch.org/Eng/Search/frameset_search.asp"><font
size="4">http://www.familysearch.org/Eng/Search/frameset_search.asp</font></a><font
size="4"> (the IGI index). However, there are many mistakes in
these entries, it is always best to go to the original source if
possible. These church records, in England anyway, only go up to
about 1837, when births, marriages and deaths had to be
registered. It gets harder to trace families later, particularly
since censuses are only released after 100 years, and people
tended to move around more towards recent times. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Better than all the official records though, is
your own family. Contact all the relations you know, and ask them
to contact all the relations <u>they</u> know, to see what they
can add to your records. After all, you may not at the moment
know all your second cousins, but they may have some useful
family heirlooms of your common great-grandparents. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">It may be a family tree written in a bible, or
family photos, or even just memories of your ancestors' lives.
These human-interest aspects <u>cannot</u> be found in official
records, (unless possibly they were mentioned in a newspaper).
Your relations can hopefully get you back to a time when official
records are more useful.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">There is no need to rush into searching through
official records, they will not go away, and in fact it gets
easier with time, as more data is put onto the web, and censuses
are released after 100 years. </font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="4">But if you think you might like to trace
    your family tree one day, it is vital to starting asking your
    relations NOW. Memories fade with time, and sadly eventually
    elderly relatives will die. It would be a lasting tribute to
    them if you have recorded all their family stories, perhaps
    even videoed interviews to keep for the future. </font></p>
