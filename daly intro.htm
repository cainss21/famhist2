hspace="0" width="328" height="497">This site is dedicated to the
memory of my great grandfather Regimental Sergeant Major Simeon
Thomas Daly, and his brother Corporal John Francis Daly, who were
both killed on the Western Front within a year of each other.
Very sad to think of my grandmother losing her father Simeon when
she was only five. </p>

<p>Their parents were John Daly, a coachman from Ireland, and
Cecilia Eliza Targett from Wiltshire. Cecilia sadly died in Q1
1909. The 1911 census says that 2 of their children had already
died, presumably in infancy as they do not appear on any census. </p>

<p>The photo shows John, Simeon, and their older brother
Frederick at the bottom. </p>

<p>They also had a younger sister Ethel, who moved to France, and
visited Simeon's grave just after the war. </p>

<p>Frederick has an armband with a red crown showing that he has
attested to be willing to serve in the forces, as part of the
&quot;Derby scheme&quot; which started in October 1915. Attested
men were placed in groups according to their age and marital
status, and the groups would then be called up when needed,
prioritising single men over those who were married. </p>

<p>This photo shows John with younger sister Ethel and older
brother Frederick. John seems to be well wrapped up, and fully
kitted out ready to go back into the front line. Both photos show
Frederick with his Derby armband, so must have been taken when
John was on leave some time between Oct 1915 and June 1916.</p>

<p>Ethel moved to France after WW1, married a Frenchman before
1930 and lived through the German occuption in WW2.</p>

<p>Frederick also joined the army and he said he was badly gassed
at some point. He died from lung problems in 1939.</p>

<p>John died during the Battle of the Somme on 20th July 1916 and
has no known grave but may be one of the 3,593 unidentified
burials in the Delville Wood cemetary. He is also remembered on
the Thiepval memorial.</p>

<p>Simeon died in the Battle of Arras on 13th April 1917 and is
buried in the Wancourt cemetery east of Arras. He is also
remembered on the war memorial at St. Oswald's church, Fulford,
York.</p>

<p>They died in similar ways, 9 months apart. Both took part in a
very sucessful first day of a major battle, in a very well
planned attack, and advanced several miles. Their units were then
rested for several days, then thrown back into a hasty-planned
follow up attack where their units suffered heavy losses and they
were killed.</p>

<p>They are both remembered at St Alban's Church, Finchley, near
the family home. <a

<p>My Grandma, Kay aged 3 with her younger brother Thomas Horace,
and their mother Sarah, wife of Simeon Daly, in 1915. They look
so sad, as though already anticipating losing their husband and
father.</p>
