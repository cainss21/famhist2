hspace="0" width="328" height="497">This site is dedicated to the
memory of my great grandfather Regimental Sergeant Major Simeon
Thomas Daly, and his brother Corporal John Francis Daly, who were
both killed on the Western Front within a year of each other.
Very sad to think of my grandmother losing her father Simeon when
she was only five. </p>

<p>Their father was John Daly, who had been working for the Earl
of Kilmair as a bailiff in Ireland, never a popular job. There
was an Irish famine in 1779, and the Irish Land League from
1879-1882 organised tenants to resist landlords. The &quot;Plan
of Campaign&quot; from 1886 to 1891 saw Irish politicians again
organising tenant farmers to resist landlords and their bailiffs.
(The whole movement until 1923 is known as the <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_War">Land War</a>. </p>

<p>John Daly married Cecilia Eliza Targett from Wiltshire, in
early 1880 in London. Their first child John Francis Daniel Daly
was born June 1st 1880 but died only 8 weeks later. John may have
moved back to Ireland to keep working, because they had no more
children until 1887. There was a newspaper story in the Kerry
Evening Post October 17th 1885 which mentions a John Daly bailiff
who had executed an eviction order, so this may be him.</p>

<p>Their next son Frederick was born in London in August 1887.
John Daly by this time was coachman, so he had probably found a
new job in London. He would have been under great pressure to
move away from being a baliff in Ireland. Simeon Thomas Daly was
born 1890 and John Francis born 1892. John Daly then got a
coachman job with <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Nicholson">Sir
Charles Nicholson</a> in Totteridge North London, and the family
moved into the Grange Lodge, across the road from Sir Charles's
Grange. Ethel Daly was born there in 1897 and William Daniel born
in 1904. William seems to have died before 1911, because John
said that two of his children had already died. Sir Charles died
in 1903, suceeded by his son also Charles who must have continued
to employ John Daly.</p>

<p>Sadly their mother Cecilia also died, in January 1909, only 49
years old. Simeon had joined the army in January 1907 but was
home from Aldershot Barracks to be present at his mother's death.
In 1911 he was in barracks at York, Ethel was at a Catholic
school &quot;for workhouse children&quot;, and John Francis was a
shop assistant living with his father, who was still a coachman.
A family letter says that his father refused to ever learn to
drive a motor car, so he had to stop work at some point.</p>

<p>The wartime photo shows John, Simeon, and their older brother
Frederick at the bottom. John probably joined the army around
Sept 1914 when his battalion was formed, the 10th Essex. In the
photo Simeon already has his RSM crown, John is a Corporal and
Frederick has an armband with a red crown showing that he has
attested to be willing to serve in the forces, as part of the
&quot;Derby scheme&quot; which started in October 1915. Attested
men were placed in groups according to their age and marital
status, and the groups would then be called up when needed,
prioritising single men over those who were married. </p>

<p>This photo shows John with younger sister Ethel and older
brother Frederick. John seems to be well wrapped up, and fully
kitted out ready to go back into the front line. Both photos show
Frederick with his Derby armband, so must have been taken when
John was on leave some time between Oct 1915 when the Derby
scheme started, and July 1916 when John was killed.</p>

<p>Ethel moved to France after WW1, married a Frenchman in 1921
and lived through the German occuption in WW2. She visited
Simeon's grave and had her picture taken, see the link to Simeon
Thomas Daly.</p>

<p>Frederick also joined the army, perhaps in 1918, and he said
he was badly gassed at some point. He died from lung problems in
1939.</p>

<p>John died during the Battle of the Somme on 20th July 1916 and
has no known grave but may be one of the 3,593 unidentified
burials in the Delville Wood cemetary. He is also remembered on
the Thiepval memorial.</p>

<p>Simeon died in the Battle of Arras on 13th April 1917 and is
buried in the Wancourt cemetery east of Arras. He is also
remembered on the war memorial at St. Oswald's church, Fulford,
York.</p>

<p>They died in similar ways, 9 months apart. Both took part in a
very sucessful first day of a major battle, in a very well
planned attack, and advanced several miles. Their units were then
rested for several days, then thrown back into a hastily-planned
follow up attack where their units suffered heavy losses and they
were killed.</p>

<p>They are both remembered at St Alban's Church, Finchley, near
the family home. <a

<p>My Grandma, Kay aged 3 with her younger brother Thomas Horace,
and their mother Sarah, wife of Simeon Daly, in 1915. They look
so sad, as though already anticipating losing their husband and
father.</p>
