<p><font size="4">John Paul Jones was born in July 1747 in
Scotland, but emigrated to America, and in the War of
Independance fought on the American side. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">In 1778 he sailed in the Ranger, a sloop, to
attack the west coast of Britain, firstly Whitehaven. The most
impresssive aspect of his actions for me was how much he managed
to accomplish with such an unwilling crew. When he asked for
volunteers to sail in small boats to attack Whitehaven harbour,
the lieutenants refused and feigned illness. The
&quot;volunteers&quot; sailed in two boats with combustables to
burn shipping in the harbour. However the crew of the other boat
said they were &quot;frightened by noises&quot; and their candles
had gone out so they achieved nothing, and they actually went
ashore into an alehouse ! Jones and several of his men from his
boat entered the fort and spiked the guns, but on return to his
boat even this crew had also managed to extinguish their candles.
This crew had planned to sail off without him if they could. He
did manage to set fire to one vessel before the alarm was raised
by a traitor sounding the alarm running through the streets.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In September 1779 Jones was back in another
ship, the Bonhomme Richard. It was very slow, poorly armed with
whatever cannons Jones had managed to find, and crewed by a
bewildering mixture of nationalities including fifty English
prisoners-of-war ! Another six ships sailed with the flotilla,
but the captains were certainly not under command of Jones, but
had been &quot;invited to join&quot; the cruise. Jones was
determined to attack a port on the east coast of Britain. He
planned to attack Leith and demand a ransom from nearby Edinburgh
otherwise he would burn the towns. This would be retaliation for
the British burning American coastal towns. (While sailing up the
Firth of Forth towards Leith, a town official did not recognise
them and sailed out in a small boat to ask whether they could
spare any powder and shot because they had heard the &quot;pirate
Jones&quot; was in the area!) A gale then blew up and forced the
fleet away from Leith.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Jones then sailed down to Newcastle, captured a
sloop, and was determined to burn the colliers in the bay to cut
off the coal supply from London. However, the other captains
would not take part, it seems they were more interested in
prizes, and Jones finally decided he could not make this raid on
his own. A letter from Sunderland says &quot;they so much alarmed
the inhabitants that many of them immediately had their valuable
effects either buried in the earth or conveyed up the country.
The militia there beat to arms and with many of the town's people
lined the shore until morning.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Jones then sailed further south and stayed
around Flamborough Head and Hull for two days, capturing other
small ships. The towns of </font><a href="defense-of-hull.htm"><font
size="4">Hull</font></a><font size="4"> and </font><a
href="alexander%20cairens.htm#JPJ on family page"><font size="4">Bridlington</font></a><font
size="4"> were on full alert for an invasion. See links for
details. My ancestor </font><a
href="alexander%20cairens.htm#JPJ on family page"><font size="4">Alexander
Cairens</font></a><font size="4"> was on guard duty on the coast.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Finally on the 23rd Sept he sighted the
long-awaited Baltic convey escorted by the warships Serapis and
Countess of Scarborough. The merchant ships retreated north to
shelter under the guns of Scarborough Castle while the escorts
faced Jones's fleet. The battle of Flamborough Head had begun. </font></p>
