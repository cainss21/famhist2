<p><font size="4">Henry Cairens (later known as Henry Cains) was
baptised in Market Weighton, East Yorkshire, England, on 11th Jan
1808. His parents were </font><a
href="family%20of%20alexander%20cairens.htm"><font size="4">Alexander
Cairens</font></a><font size="4"> , a labourer, and Mary Parkin.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">He remembered seeing the Yorkshire Giant, </font><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Bradley_(giant)"><font
size="4">William Bradley</font></a><font size="4">, at his
outsized home in Market Weighton. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">He seems to have found a job at Clock Mill in
Pocklington working for John Scaife, before 1839. John died in
May 1839 only 46 years old. Henry married his widow, Hannah
Scaife, in June 1840. Hannah was 8 or 9 years older and had
inherited Clock Mill in Pocklington, so this was certainly a step
up the social ladder for the son of a labourer. Her two children
George and Ann lived with them, shown on the 1841 census. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">By the 1851 census they had bought and moved
into Devonshire Mills at Canal Head in Pocklington. (</font><a

size="4">Map</font></a><font size="4">) They employed a servant
girl Elizabeth Gray, aged 17. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Hannah died on 30.7.1861. Just over a year
later Henry married again, at the age of 54, to his former
servant girl. She was 17 years his junior. Henry married
Elizabeth Gray on 16.11.1862. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">They had five children :-</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="4">Henry Parkin Cains born 20.4.1863 (his
    father claimed he was born very premature !), Sarah Mary
    Cains born 2.8.1865, Ann Marina Cains born 17.8.1866, Harriet
    Maud Mary Cains born 29.1.1868, and Francis George Cains
    19.2.1871. So Henry had his last child when he was 63 ! More
    details </font><a href="henry-cains-family.htm"><font
    size="4">here</font></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4">Elizabeth died on 10.1.1880, and Henry married
for a third time, in 3rd quarter of 1882 to Mary Goodyear, when
he was at least 71 ! She was 20 years younger than him. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Henry finally died on 4.10.1891, aged 83. He
put down his long life to eating so much healthy wholemeal bread
from his corn mills.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">This is the grave of Henry with his first wife
Hannah, in the oldest part of the Pocklington church graveyard.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">I am the great-grandson of </font><a
href="henry-cains-family.htm"><font size="4">Henry Parkin Cains</font></a><font
size="4"> ( Parkin was his grandmother's maiden name). Henry
Parkin Cains carried on the milling profession, and also lived to
a great age, 96. My Dad is now retired but is very interested in
milling, and shows tourists round a rebuilt working water mill.
He was proud to show my son the flour sacks from his great-great
grandad's mill displayed on the walls.</font></p>
