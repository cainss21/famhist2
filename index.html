<p><font size="4">Hello, and welcome to my family history
website.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">My cousin in Australia, Lesley Cains has been
doing a great job tracking down other Cains relatives and
pointing them to this site, so if you are one of these, then
welcome to the Cains clan !</font></p>

<p><font size="4">From here you can read about our ancestor </font><a

size="4"> who was involved in the defense of the Yorkshire coast
when </font><a href="johnpauljones.htm"><font size="4">John Paul
Jones</font></a><font size="4"> fought the famous battle of
Flamborough Head in 1779 against the British warship Serapis.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Here are </font><a
href="family%20of%20alexander%20cairens.htm"><font size="4">Alexander
Cairens's children</font></a><font size="4">, who later changed
their name to Cains. I have recently been able to trace several
Cains relatives descended from this family.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">His son </font><a href="henry-cairens.htm"><font
size="4">Henry Cairens</font></a><font size="4"> (later Henry
Cains), my great-great grandad who married first a rich widow,
then married his servant girl when aged 54, had children up the
age of 63, then married a third time when he was 74 !</font></p>

various websites, for instance </font><a
