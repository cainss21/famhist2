<p><font size="4">In 1779 the Northumberland militia had nine
companies, each of around 64 men, with usually 1 lieutenant, 3
sergeants and 2 drummers. A tenth company was formed by Captain
Edward Dale in 1779. The commanding officer in 1779 was the Right
Honourable Lord Algernon Percy, Colonel, of the ancient Percy
family of Northumberland.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The annual returns give the number of men at
different heights, (hardly 5 % were over 5 foot 10 inches,
average around 5 foot 6), their nationality (one sixth were from
Scotland), years of service ( a wide spread from 4 to 20 years,
but 2/3rds of them had 3 years or less) and age (mostly 20 to 35,
but a few up to 45).</font></p>

<p><font size="4">There was a grenadier company of the tallest
men, (although average still only 5 foot 10 inches) , these were
the elite of the regiment. The shortest men were put in a
&quot;light&quot; company, mostly under 5 foot 6.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">At the annual inspections, the men were judged
on marching, firing, manoeuvers, and the state of their arms,
accoutrements and clothing.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The equipment returns show that each man had a
firelock, a bayonet, a cartridge box, a waist belt, pouch with
shoulder belt, and sling. The grenadiers had a sword and a match
case. The mens' clothing stock was one coat, one set of breeches,
one shirt, one pair of shoes, one pair of stockings, one hat or
cap, and one roller (scarf). This was still the time of the
&quot;lace wars&quot; when clothing was still fairly soft and
comfortable, before the rigid &quot;stocks&quot; which held men's
heads upright in the time of the Napoleonic wars.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In the 1778 inspection just after they had been
called up, the firearms were those they had received in 1759, the
time of the last invasion alarm, although they were still
described as good condition. The accoutrements (belts, pouches
and slings) were described as &quot;bad&quot; condition,
presumably also 20 years old. The clothes were all new or a year
old. The inspection report was mostly very good, although their
marching was very slow. The men were &quot;a very good body of
men, straight and well limbed, some few short, but the Grenadier
company very fine&quot;. However the non-commissioned officers
who should have set a good example were &quot;some very old and
very indifferent in their appearence&quot; !</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In the 1779 inspection, the regiment was able
to report they had received new equipment in September 1778 and
after a year of training they were at a very high standard, with
no word of critisism. Even the non-commissioned officers were now
&quot;remarkably good appearance, smart, attentive and
expert&quot;. Overall, the comment on the regiment was
&quot;Great pains and attention have been taken upon this
regiment, which is a very fine one. It is not so tall as the 2nd
regiment of York, but it is more steady under Arms. I hold this
regiment fit for any immediate home service&quot;.</font></p>
