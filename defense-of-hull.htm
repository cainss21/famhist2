<p><font size="4">As </font><a href="johnpauljones.htm"><font
size="4">John Paul Jones</font></a><font size="4"> sailed off
Hull in September 1779, the Marquis of Rockingham (the leader of
the Opposition) travelled to the town, since he was also the High
Sheriff of Hull. He later wrote an account to their Lordships in
London :-</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;..The artillery in the fort, its only
defense, were unserviceable both from the carriages being
entirely rotten and also from most of the guns which carried any
weight of metal being honeycombed and dangerous to use. New
carriages had been ordered for some of the cannon but they were
at Woolwich to be ironed, and indeed if they had been at Hull,
very few of the 18 pounders and 9 pounders could have been
mounted on them as those cannon were so universally reckoned
unserviceable and dangerous...</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;It appeared to me ... that there could
not be [many] soldiers or marines on board the squadron, or that
with what seamen he could have spared from the ships, that [only
a small] force could be landed by Paul Jones, which the Yorkshire
Regt of militia under Col Harvey were as able as they were
willing and desirous, to repell. Part of the </font><a
href="alexander%20cairens.htm"><font size="4">Northumberland
militia</font></a><font size="4"> were also at Beverley and the
neighbourhood ... </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I conceived very differently in regard to
an attempt being made by the squadron coming up Humber. I
therefore pressed as much as I possibly could that every effort
should be made to prepare batteries and get what artillery could
be had.&quot; (He then described news of the battle of
Flamborough Head, </font><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Flamborough_Head">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Flamborough_Head</a>
<font size="4">where </font><a href="johnpauljones.htm"><font
size="4">John Paul Jones</font></a><font size="4"> fought the
British ship Serapis). &quot;Great hopes were entertained in the
ability and valour of Capt Pierson of the Serapis. The
unfortunate event of their being captured after a most severe
engagement came to our knowledge at Hull on the Friday evening
when the mayor immediately called a meeting at which the
proposition of of preparing batteries was unanimously adopted. I
was informed that a vessel was detained in the port of Hull on
the appearence of Paul Jones's squadron on which there was twenty
18 pounders , some 12 pounders and a few 9 pounders which were
going according to orders from the ordnance to Woolwich. I
ventured to suggest and press that the twenty 18 pounders
particularly should be landed and that carriages should
immediately be prepared for them..</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;It was said at first that it would
require 7 or 10 days to make serviceable carriages for them but
in less than half an hour two of the capitol block makers in Hull
came to us at the meeting and contracted to deliver the 20
carriages by nine o'clock on the next day (Saturday) evening. I
had the satisfaction to see several of these carriages ready for
use by 12 o'clock on the Saturday morning. The guns were taken
out of the ship's hold on the Saturday morning and some of them
mounted and carried to the Artillery Guard where there formerly
had been a battery and which in a few hours would have been ready
for use.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Finally they heard the news that John Paul
Jones had sailed away in the captured Serapis. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">In the letter above, Rockingham continually
asserted he was only doing his duty, but in a private letter to
his wife, Rockingham ( the leader of the Opposition in
parliament) wrote &quot;My chief object was to persuade them that
the government had neglected them&quot; ! </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Rockingham became prime minister again, so his
ambition succeeded.</font></p>
