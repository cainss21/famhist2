    <p><font size="5"><u>Gordon riots</u></font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="4">These were some of the most fierce riots ever
in London. A meeting was organised by Lord George Gordon in 1779
to protest at a bill which was just to &quot;relieve his
Majesty's subjects of the Catholic Religion, from certain
penalties and disabilities imposed upon them during the reign of
William III&quot;. This was interpreted by the angry mob as
&quot;Popery&quot;. They demolished Catholic chapels, broken open
Newgate prison, and much else besides, and resolved to attack the
Bank of England. Finally the authorities realised that they must
ask the military to crush the riots. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Several newspapers mentioned the part played by
the </font><a href="northumberland-militia.htm"><font size="4">Northumberland
militia</font></a><font size="4"> :-</font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="4">&quot;About 11 pm a party of the
    Northumberland militia came into Holburn; they had marched
    that day nearly 40 miles, and the moment they arrived at
    their place of rendevouz, which was Lincoln's Inn Fields,
    they were sent into Holburn. As soon as they appeared before
    the bonfire in front of Mr Langdale's house, the Insurgents
    attacked them. The party then discharged their pieces, but as
    they were only loaded with powder no harm was done; this
    experiment was tried to intimidate the ruffians, for strict
    orders had been given to use every lenient measure before
    coming to extremity, but it had no effect.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4">&quot;The Insurgents continued their
    attack, and one of the officers being very much hurt, it was
    found absolutely neccessary to fire with ball; yet the fire
    was very prudently conducted, for the soldiers were not
    permited to fire along the street. Their officers drew them
    up on the north side of Holburn, fronting the bonfire and the
    house on fire, so that no person could be hurt but those who
    were rioting round the fire, burning the furniture and casks,
    and those who were still in the house plundering it. By the
    second volley, two or three were killed.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4">&quot;This judicious conduct of the
    officers deserves great praise, for the streets were much
    crowded by people, moving their most valuable goods, as they
    did not know where the fire would stop. No innocent person
    could suffer by the firing, for it went directly across the
    bonfire into the house. This second volley had the proper
    effect, and drove off the insurgents from the front of the
    houses.&quot; - <em>Scot's magazine, July 1780.</em></font></p>

<blockquote>
    <p><font size="4"><em>&quot;</em>It would be unpardonable not
    to mention that the steady conduct of the Northumberland
    Militia under the command of Lord Algernon Percy, occasioned
    a most effectual check to be given to the violence of the
    rioters, on the Wednesday night, at the burning of Fleet
    Prison; when it is a known fact, that soon after they had
    fired, the Corps twice presented and twice recovered their
    arms, without a single man discharging his piece, although
    the mob were at that time using every means to irritate and
    provoke them.&quot; - <em>Gentlemen's magazine July 1781</em></font></p>

        account of the riots in Barnaby Rudge, but it gives a
        very vivid picture of life in these times. Chapter 66
        covers the climax of the military action, Chapter 67
        mentions the Northumberland Militia.</font></li>
