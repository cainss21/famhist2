<p><font size="6"><u>Family of Alexander Cairens</u> </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Alexander Cairens married Mary Binnington on
10th Feb 1779 at Market Weighton (although the IGI index say it
was at Shipton by Thorpe). In the marriage banns he is described
as &quot;of the Northumberland militia, quartered in this
parish&quot;, but in the marriage record he is described as a
labourer. (So banns of marriage can give useful information).</font><font

<p><font size="4">My family called themselves Cains after about
1810. Cains is still quite an unusual surname, so I have tried to
trace children of each of these using the </font><a
href="http://www.familysearch.org/Eng/default.asp"><font size="4">IGI</font></a><font
size="4"> registers, as shown above, with various spelling of the
surname, but I can never be certain that a person marrying is the
same as one of Alexander's children. </font><font size="3">(The
Cairens family are listed in the </font><a
href="http://www.familysearch.org/Eng/default.asp"><font size="3">IGI</font></a><font
size="3"> index, in the Karren section, but they have details
wrong, such as having Alexander's wife as Anne).</font></p>

<p><font size="4">As far as I knew, my two brothers and I were
almost the only Cains descendants of all this family because many
people had daughters who lost the Cains name on marriage, but I
have recently had contacts from lots of Cains relatives in
Hertfordshire and Australia. Please email me if you know of any
other descendants of these people, especially still living. My
email address is simon @ cains . myzen . co .uk</font></p>

<p><font size="4">One book about the Cairns family of Scotland
has been published :- A History of the Cairnes or Cairns and its
connections, by Henry Cairns Lawlor, published by Ellliot Stock
1906. It is very hard to track down. There is a digital scan here

include the family trees from the book.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In Burke's Peerage, there is a Cairns family,
but the oldest Cairns family are detailed in the
&quot;Rossmore&quot; family entry.</font></p>
